# Before migrating

* Update yourself with the latest OCA Conventions: https://odoo-community.org/page/contributing
* Subscribe to the mailing list of the related project: https://odoo-community.org/groups
* Announce on the corresponding GitHub issue with the name "Migration to version 14.0" which module(s) you want to migrate

# Tasks to do in the migration

* Bump module version to `14.0.1.0.0`.
* Remove any possible migration script from previous version.
* Squash administrative commits (if any) with the previous commit for reducing commit noise. They are named as "[UPD] README.rst", "[UPD] Update $MODULE.pot", "Update translation files" and similar names, and comes from *OCA-git-bot*, *oca-travis* or *oca-transbot*. **IMPORTANT**: Don't squash legit translation commits, authored by their translators, with the message "Translated using Weblate (...)".
* If you add new values in a selection field through `selection_add`, you have to define a new `ondelete=` attribute setting the value to assign for each previous value in case of uninstallation. More info at https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/f0481392c6501cae2c38359f526da1eefa451337. Example: `selection_field = fields.Selection(selection_add=[("foo", "Foo")], ondelete={"foo": "set null"})`.
* In the XML views, the `invisible` and `readonly` attributes no longer support dynamic expressions like `state=='draft'`. When using those, use the `attrs` attribute instead. You can only use them for direct context queries like `context.get('invisible')`.
* XML shortcut tags `<act_window>` and `<report>` are no longer valid, and must be replaced by its full definition through `<record>` tag.
* If there are transient models, you have to add explicit security ACLs for them (and optionally record rules).
* If you were overriding `_compute_display_name` for getting a different `display_name`, you should now override `name_get` method and add there the needed `@api.depends`. This is not valid though if you want to make `display_name` stored for allowing a direct `name_search`. Other option is to override `name_search` instead.
* Remove `size=X` attribute in `Char` fields, as it's no longer valid for restricting the size of the strings.
* `_name_search` is now returning ids instead of the `name_get` style tuple (list of `(id, display_name)`): https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/1f48130d2bd055835ee428a21922331d126285a3
* Replace appearances of `.with_context(force_company=...)` with `.with_company(...)`.
* The access to `ir.actions.*` objects has been removed, so you need to use `sudo` or interact via the /web/action/load controller.
See odoo/odoo#53335 for more information.
* Check tasks of previous versions if you are migrating from lower versions than v13. It's also recommended to check past migration guides for things not done in previous migrations.
* Add tests to increase code coverage.
* Do the rest of the changes you need to do for making the module works on new version.

# Howto

## Technical method to migrate a module from "13.0" to "14.0" branch

* `$REPO`: the OCA repository hosting the module
* `$MODULE`: the name of the module you want to migrate
* `$USER_ORG`: your GitHub login or organization name

**Full process**

* On a shell command:
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/OCA/$REPO -b 14.0
  $ git checkout -b 14.0-mig-$MODULE origin/14.0
  $ git format-patch --keep-subject --stdout origin/14.0..origin/13.0 -- $MODULE | git am -3 --keep
  $ pre-commit run -a  # to run black, isort and prettier (ignore pylint errors at this stage)
  $ git add -A
  $ git commit -m "[IMP] $MODULE: black, isort, prettier"  --no-verify  # it is important to do all formatting in one commit the first time
  ```
* Check https://github.com/OCA/maintainer-tools/wiki/Merge-commits-in-pull-requests for a procedure for reducing commits from "OCA Transbot...".
* Adapt the module to the 14.0 version following tasks to do.
* On a shell command, type this for uploading the content to GitHub:
  ```bash
  $ git add --all
  $ git commit -m "[MIG] $MODULE: Migration to 14.0"
  $ git remote add $USER_ORG git@github.com:$USER_ORG/$REPO.git # This mode requires an SSH key in the GitHub account
  $ ... or ....
  $ git remote add $USER_ORG https://github.com/$USER_ORG/$REPO.git # This will required to enter user/password each time
  $ git push $USER_ORG 14.0-mig-$MODULE --set-upstream
  ```
* Follow the link on the command line or check in https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork how to create the pull request.

**Troubleshooting**

Sometimes, when performing these operations, the process can hang due to conflicts on the patches being applied. One of the possible problems is because a patch removes entirely a file and `git am` is not able to resolve this. It ends with a message `error: ...: patch does not apply`.

If that's your case, you can add `--ignore-whitespace` at the end of the `git am` command for allowing the patch to be applied, although there will be still conflicts to be solved, but they will be doable through standard conflict resolution system. Starting from the previous situation, you will need to do:

```bash
git am --abort
git format-patch --keep-subject --stdout origin/14.0..origin/13.0 -- <module path> | git am -3 --keep --ignore-whitespace
# resolve conflicts (for example git rm <file>)
git add --all
git am --continue
```
